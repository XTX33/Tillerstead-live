  <h2 id="privacy-heading">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    Tillerstead LLC ("we," "our," or "us") is a licensed and insured contractor serving
    South Jersey. We operate <a href="https://tillerstead.com">tillerstead.com</a> and
    collect only the information needed to respond to inquiries, schedule work, and run
    our business responsibly.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contact details</strong> such as your name, phone number, email, and project address.</li>
    <li><strong>Project details</strong> like descriptions, measurements, photos, timelines, and budget goals you provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data</strong> such as IP address, browser type, and device data collected by hosting or basic analytics tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To respond to inquiries, schedule consultations, and provide estimates.</li>
    <li>To plan, perform, document, and invoice contracting services.</li>
    <li>To improve our website, messaging, and service processes.</li>
    <li>To comply with New Jersey licensing, insurance, and record-keeping requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell or trade personal data. Information may be shared only with service
    providers (hosting, email, CRM, payment, or financing partners) when needed to fulfill
    your request and always under privacy-law compliance.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Cookies &amp; analytics</h2>
  <p>
    This site may use basic cookies and analytics to understand traffic and performance.
    Cookies are optional and can be disabled in your browser settings; doing so will not
    prevent you from reading the site, though form functionality may be limited.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    Contact and project details are retained as long as necessary to respond to requests,
    maintain service records, and meet legal or insurance obligations. Routine backups and
    log files may be kept for a limited time for security and troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable safeguards to protect information submitted through our forms and
    communications. No online transmission is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee
    absolute protection against threats beyond our control.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can ask us to update or delete your contact details.</li>
    <li>You can opt out of non-essential emails at any time.</li>
    <li>You can disable cookies in your browser settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Updates</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy as our services or legal requirements change. The
    "Last updated" date will reflect the most recent revision. Continued site use after
    changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
